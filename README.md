# Simulation
The aim of this project is to simulate the prosthesis using a physics engine that allows real-time control via electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography signals (EEG) and computer vision (CV).

> [!NOTE]
> For now, the goal is to use this simulation to test firmware 

## Demonstration
